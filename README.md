My name is Federica and I am a Statistician and Actuary with a specialization in risk assessments. 

🏃‍♀️ Currently, I am working on several projects, including the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) in collaboration with IHME. 

👩🏻‍🍳 I am also actively learning RStudio at an Instructor level and practicing with the R4DS online learning community.

🌱 I am interested in collaborating on advanced statistical programs and would be happy to discuss anything related to Statistics, R, or GitHub.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy making data visualizations and studying infectious diseases
